The game is outlined in [game manual 2](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/game-manual-part-2.pdf).
Clarifications to the game rules are issued on the Question & Answer section
of the [forum at](ftcforum.usfirst.org). Forum rulings take precedence over
information in the game manuals.

## Objective

Two Alliances – one “Red” and one “Blue”, composed of two Teams each – compete
in each Match. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the
opposing Alliance by locating and delivering Stones and Skystones from the
Loading Zone to the Building Zone, building the highest Skyscraper, and
placing the Capstone on the Skyscraper. The game is played in two distinct
periods: Autonomous and Driver-Controlled.

## Competition Overview

### Autonomous the first 30 seconds

The Match starts with a 30-second Autonomous Period in which Robots operate
using only pre-programmed instructions and sensor inputs. During the
Autonomous Period, Alliances earn points by: Repositioning their Foundation
in their Building Site; Delivering Stones from the Loading Zone to the
Building Zone; Placing Stones on their Foundation; and Navigating their
Robots under their segment of the Skybridge.

### Driver Controlled 90 seconds

The two-minute Driver-Controlled Period follows the Autonomous Period. During
the Driver-Controlled Period, Alliances earn points by Delivering and Placing
Stones from the Loading Zone to the Building Stone. Robots will also build
Skyscrapers to go as high as possible without toppling over.

### End Game final 30 seconds of the driver controlled period 120 seconds

The final 30 seconds of the Driver Controlled Period is called the End Game.
In addition to the previously listed Driver-Controlled Period Scoring
activities, Alliances earn points by Capping their Skyscrapers with a
Team-supplied Capstone, moving their Foundations out of the Building Site,
and Parking their Robot in their Building Site.

## Scoring

### Autonomous Scoring

1) Repositioning – A Foundation In the corresponding Alliance Building
Site at the end of the Autonomous Period and not in contact with a
corresponding Alliance Robot will earn ten (10) points for their Alliance.

2) Stone Delivery – An Alliance will earn points for Delivering Stones from
their Quarry under their Alliance’s Skybridge per the following criteria.
Points are awarded based on the order the Stones are Delivered independently
by each Alliance.
1. Initial two Stones Delivered - If these are Skystones, the Alliance will
earn ten (10) points each.
If these are Stones, the Alliance will earn two (2) points each.
1. Remaining Stones Delivered: Both Stones and Skystones earn two (2) points each.
1. Each Stone Returned during the Autonomous Period deducts two (2) points, except if the first
Stone Returned is a Skystone, which deducts ten (10) points.


3) Navigating – Each Robot that is Parked over the tape separating the
Loading Zone from the Building Zone and under their Alliance’s Skybridge at
the end of the Autonomous Period will earn five (5) points for their Alliance.

4) Placing – Each Stone (Stone or Skystone) In the Foundation at the end of
the Autonomous Period earns four (4) points.

### Driver Mode

1) Stone Delivery – Each Stone (Stone or Skystone) Delivered by going under
the corresponding Alliance Skybridge for the Robot is worth one (1) point to
the Alliance that Delivered the Stone. Stones Delivered under the Alliance
neutral Skybridge are worth zero (0) points for this task. Stones Returned
deduct one (1) point each for the Alliance who Returned the Stone.

2) Placing – At the end of the Match, each Stone (Stone or Skystone) that
is In the Foundation and not in contact with an Alliance Robot when all
Scoring Elements have come to rest earns one (1) point.

3) Skyscraper Bonus – An Alliance will earn two (2) points for each
Skyscraper Level of their tallest Skyscraper that is not in Contact with
an Alliance Robot when all Scoring Elements have come to rest after the End
of the Driver-Controlled Period. If there are multiple Skyscrapers at the
same height, only one Skyscraper Bonus will be earned.

### End Game

1) Capping – An Alliance will earn points for placing a Capstone On their
Foundation or any Skyscraper on their Alliance’s Foundation. A Robot cannot
be in contact with the Capstone in order for the points to count. The points
are awarded as follows:
a) Five (5) points for each Capstone that is fully Supported On a Skyscraper
or Foundation. A Capstone may be placed On another legally scored Capstone
and still earn points.
b) One (1) point for each Level that Supports a Capstone. Note: If placed
onto another Capstone, the lower Capstone does not count as a Level.
c) Multiple Capstones on the same Skyscraper will each earn points.
d) A Robot may only Score one (1) Capstone.

2) Foundation Moved – An Alliance will earn fifteen (15) points if their
Foundation has been moved Completely Out of the Building Site by the End of
the Match. The Foundation must have been In the Building Site at the start
of End Game in order to earn these points.

3) Parking - An Alliance will earn five (5) points for each Robot that is
Parked In their Alliance’s Building Site at the end of the Match (T=0:00).
