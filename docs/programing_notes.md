# Introduction

As a starting reference I have been reading ["2017-2018 FIRST Â® Tech Challenge Android Studio Programming Training Manual"](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-tutorial.pdf)

It is a little dated but it seems to be working.

## FTC SDK

SDK = Software Developer's Kit and includes the starting point of any FTC Robot.  The [FTC SDK is on GitHub](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone)
this link is different than in the reference below but the same steps apply.  BEFORE installing the SDK you must accept
the Android liscnese by running this command

```bash
 yes | sudo ~/Android/Sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```
## Sample code

The FTC SDK includes lots of samples that you can build upon.

```
Sample opmodes exist in the FtcRobotController module.
To locate these samples, find the FtcRobotController module in the "Project/Android" tab.

Expand the following tree elements:
 FtcRobotController / java / org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller / external / samples
 ```
